# math_ML_seminar

Some implementations of what I have learned in the seminar [mathematics of machine learning](https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/math/groups/ag-math_machine_learning/teaching/machine-learning4.html) in winter semester 2018-2019.

Since the seminar is mostly about theory, the programming is not necessary for students. But I think it is necessary to understand when and how to use the methods learned in the seminar.

That's bascially the reason I start to do this. The notes/ summary are posted in my [blog](https://dorianhe.github.io/).
